# NDIS Guidance Application for Royal Society for the Blind

### Docassemble

This Docassemble package contains the source code and other resources used 
within the NDIS Guidance Service tool created for RSB.

### Overview

We have been consulted by Sarah (‘the client’), an Adaptive Technology Specialist Trainer at the Royal Society for the Blind (‘RSB’) to provide an application that will assist NDIS clients in understanding their plan, knowing what funds they have and how best to spend these funds.

This application was created in collaboration with students from LLAW3301: Law in a Digital Age and COMP3751: Interactive Computer Systems.
